# QVS VM Reinjector

**QVS VM Reinjector** is a full restoration toolkit for re-importing Virtualization Station VMs (QNAP) from filesystem backups, especially when `.QKVM` metadata has been lost or QVS has been reset.

This tool parses the original `.meta` folder (XMLs and snapshots), then reinjects all relevant data directly into the QVS `qvs.db` SQLite database.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Restores `vms_vm` (UUID, config, template)
- Reconstructs `vms_disk` from libvirt + snapshot chain
- Restores `vms_adapter` with preserved MAC/port_id
- Injects VNC graphics config if needed
- Detects snapshots and corrects snapshot root/active
- Optional handling for "hot backup" with `--after-boot`

## üíª Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `xmltodict` module
- Runs outside the NAS (Linux or Windows WSL)
- Access to:
  - The VM `.meta` folder (extracted from backup)
  - The `qvs.db` file from your QNAP (exported via SCP/SFTP)

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python3 inject_vm_full.py \
  --meta_folder /path/to/.uuid.meta \
  --db_path /path/to/qvs.db \
  [--after-boot]
```

> Use `--after-boot` if the VM was running or had been rebooted after the last snapshot (hot backup scenario).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Using this option may break the snapshot structure in Virtualization Station. To avoid issues:  
- Ensure the VM is **shut down** or stays **powered off**
- Then, delete all associated snapshots from the **Virtualization Station GUI**

You may encounter this error once:

```
[Virtualization Station] Failed to delete snapshot "Snapshot_145706" for virtual machine "srvdocker". Error message: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'children'
```

‚úÖ To fix this:
- Manually delete the remaining `.xml` file inside the VM‚Äôs `snapshot/` directory (within the `.meta` folder)
- The snapshot structure should then be operational


## üß† Design philosophy

- Fully idempotent: re-running scripts doesn't create duplicates
- No destructive DELETEs: only `UPDATE` and smart `INSERT` operations
- Modular: one Python file per table for easier debugging and testing


## üîí Disclaimer

Ensure you keep a full, untouched backup of your system before proceeding, and retain it until all your data has been successfully recovered and a proper backup strategy is in place.

Use at your own risk. While this tool avoids destructive operations, it directly modifies the QNAP Virtualization Station database. Always make a backup of `qvs.db` before performing any injection.
